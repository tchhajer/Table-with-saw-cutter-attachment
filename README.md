## Key Contributions
- **Integrated cutting station** eliminated the need to move materials between stations.
- **Ergonomic height and layout** allowed safer and more comfortable cutting operations.
- **Reduced operator walking time**, boosting daily throughput.
- **Supports Lean 5S**: Combines processes into one dedicated, well-organized station.

## Impact
- Enhanced **workplace safety** by reducing unnecessary movement.
- Improved **cutting accuracy and productivity**.
- Helped standardize fabrication setup across teams.

## Tools & Technologies
- CREO & Solidworks (CAD)
- Steel frame construction
- Shop layout optimization
